# OSS Etiquette

Rules for interacting with external open-source projects (issues, PRs, comments).

## Tone

- Start with gratitude — acknowledge the work maintainers have done
- Be humble — assume maintainers have reasons for their decisions
- Ask before requesting — use questions ("Are there plans to...?") instead of demands ("Please update...")
- Respect that the current state may be intentional, not an oversight

## Issues

- Use a question as the title when you don't know the maintainers' intent (e.g., "Are there plans to...?" rather than "Add feature X")
- Describe your observation and context, not just what you want
- Acknowledge possible reasons for the current behavior
- Mention your workaround briefly at the end, not as pressure

## Pull Requests

- Open an issue or discussion first before submitting a large PR to an unfamiliar project
- Follow the project's contributing guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Keep the scope small and focused — one concern per PR
- Do not assume your change will be accepted; frame it as a proposal
