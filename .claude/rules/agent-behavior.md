# Agent Behavior

- Always propose — do not wait for instructions when you see an improvement opportunity. But do not implement changes outside the approved Approach without developer approval. If the improvement affects scope, raise it as a separate issue.
- When requirements are unclear, ask the user to clarify before proceeding — do not guess or assume
- Before implementing, search official documentation to verify the correct approach — do not rely on memory alone
