# Agent Behavior

- Always propose — do not wait for instructions when you see an improvement opportunity. But do not implement changes outside the approved Approach without developer approval. If the improvement affects scope, raise it as a separate issue.
- When requirements are unclear, ask the user to clarify before proceeding — do not guess or assume
- Before implementing, search official documentation to verify the correct approach — do not rely on memory alone
- When official documentation is needed for research but the domain is not in `allowed-domains.txt`, ask the developer to add the domain
- Aim for root cause fixes — understand the purpose before acting. If the root cause cannot be resolved, explain why and consult the developer before falling back to alternatives
- After completing work, self-check: is this a workaround, patch, or irregular fix? If so, rethink the approach or consult the developer
